# InventorySystem

This is an older Java project where I needed to create a mock inventory for a company.
There needed to be both individual parts and products made up of the parts. I also needed
to have the functionality to add, delete, and modify existing parts and products.
This was one of my first experiences with basic UI elements and I used FXML to create
the interface for this project.
